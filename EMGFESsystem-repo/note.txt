Antagonist muscle EMG seem to be significantly depressed with highpass cut off at about 100-150Hz
The 100-150Hz highpass reduces  the M-wave of FES

-Two bands that shows good EMG signals are: 
[150Hz] cutoff highpass
[150-400Hz or a bit higher] bandpass(very clean but reduced amplitude)
[150-300Hz] bandpass(very clean but reduced amplitude)
NOTE you can use about 80-100Hz lower cutoff also with no too much of antagonist and M-wave contamination

[Idea]
extract data between up to 50Hz up to 100Hz and up to 150Hz; Classify the cause of increase in these bands and use the power in the bands to make descisions on when artifact is dominant
